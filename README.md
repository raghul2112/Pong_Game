# Pong Game 🏓

A two-player **Pong Game** built using Python's `turtle` graphics module.  
This project recreates the classic Pong arcade game where two players control paddles to bounce a ball back and forth.  
It’s built using **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts like classes and methods.
